SPTGUI: A Graphical User Interface for Single Particle Tracking.
=============

A GUI developed with the IDL Particle Tracking software developed by Crocker and Weeks and translated to MATLAB by Blair and Dufresne.

For more, visit (http://physics.georgetown.edu/matlab/) and (http://www.physics.emory.edu/~weeks/idl/).

Development is still on version 1 of this software.


Usage
------------

Using SPTGUI is simple. Users unfamiliar with MATLAB can start using the toolkit immediately with the following commands from the command line:

    git clone git://github.com/akivab/sptgui.git
    cd sptgui
    matlab -r run.m

MATLAB should load and the GUI should start up.
